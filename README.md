### Meal Swipe Tracker

Since the official website of my school has no real time tracker to tell me how many meal swipes I have left to use in a given week for my student meal plan, I've decided to make a manual tracker to make my life easier.


**Functionality**
- Dark and light theme, for the wellness of your eyes.
- Swapping between blue and gold plan, but no ultimate (this is a tracker, not a tally)
- Clear button (trash can icon) to clear all swipe records, so you can easily begin a new week
- Dot click to remove a dot in a given day, in case you butterfingered
- Core feature: adding a dot to represent a swipe in a given day


**Cookies**

p.s. this website will use cookies purely to store the dots representing swipes in a given day, so you can keep the information going forward in a week; there's no tracking cookies - you can confirm in the source code if you're skeptical.
